Muzzak! is a python based interface for amarok using DCOP.

Which can easily be modified to use DBUS and to support any other media player 
(rhythmbox via DBUS is fairly simple).

How it works:

It implements a very basic and stripped down HTTP server as an interface. 
Instructions from this interface are used to contorl amarok via DCOP commands.


Use:

Muzzak! can be used to let others control your music... Or to control yoru 
music with yoru web enabled device at a party, maybe even to play music to your 
pets when you're away...


Requirements:
	Amarok
	DCOP
	Python
(Or whatever you mod it for)
